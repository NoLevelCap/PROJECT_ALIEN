# PROJECT_ALIEN
A game being developed by @NoLevelCap. At the moment, it is at a really, really, really, REALLY, early stage. An arena brawler with a somewhat unique combat mechanic. The game was born out of the idea that the protagonist would wield a sword which is unwieldy and can only be used through swinging it wildly around him.
